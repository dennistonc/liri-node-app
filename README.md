# LIRI Node App

### Week 10 Homework
**About This Homework**

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

Using the commands: `concert-this`, `spotify-this-song`, `movie-this`, and `do-what-it-says`, LIRI will be able to search each correlating site for what the user has input.

**concert-this:**
To use `concert-this` as a node command, we input node liri.js concert-this *Artist Name* in the command line.
It should spit back information regarding the next upcoming concert for the user input artist.

**spotify-this-song:**
To use `spotify-this-song` as a node command, we input node liri.js spotify-this-song *Song Name* in the command line.
It should spit back information regarding the closest match for the user input song.
